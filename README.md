# AWS Configurations

This repository contains a collection of sample configurations and best practices for setting up various AWS services and infrastructure. The goal is to provide reusable configuration templates for services like EC2, S3, IAM, RDS, and others, enabling seamless setup and management of AWS resources.

## Usage
Each service folder contains configuration files that can be used to set up AWS resources.
For example, to set up EC2 instances, navigate to the ec2-setup folder and follow the instructions there.
